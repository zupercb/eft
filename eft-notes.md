what the difficulty setting does::

	easy= less waves with lower bots
	medium= bout same waves but with some more scavs
	hard= big amount of bots but still medium difficulty
	impossible= big bots with good skills
	horde= you have the last bottle of vodka and all of russia is coming after you
	

escape from tarkov | hardcore game idea::

	lower loot availability
		item flow control
			high tier/meta parts should only be with traders and super expensive.
			meta weapons should be on bosses, and rare.
			more barter items to influence barter trades.
	slowest skill multiplier setting/take out skills altogether
			why? because you are a PMC, you're supposed to be skilled already.
			but the way the multiplier works now, the skills lvl up so high that it seems like 
			you're fooking captain america. 
			either change the lore and go with it, or not.
			if you were playing a scav, skills would be good - however, this super soldier
			BS should be nerfed.
	no flea market
	no scav availability
	no insurance
	raiders or bosses
		should be on high item lvl areas
		
ai bot ideas::

	scavs builds
		aggro
			spray n pray
		group up
		run away
		sneaky
	pmcs [this should be my first priority]
		ratty
			sneaky
				but always moving
			run away
		chaddy
			spray
			grenadier
