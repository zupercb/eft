FIRST::
For Skier, strip down on guns and sell what you can to him. You can also sell some armor and helmets to him to speed up the process, but once he gets to level two, you can start modding guns like AKs so that he’ll be easier to further level up. 

For The Therapist, you should sell dogtags, meds, and valuables. Buying meds from her is also good for leveling up as well. 

And if you have any other items, just sell the rest to Praporas he’s the easiest to level up.

SECOND::
To get Ragman to level up is a bit of a challenge as, out of all the traders, he requires the most grind. Sell him helmets, armor, and maybe some rigs so go along with it. When you’ve leveled up therapist to level 2, you can opt to sell your dogtags and valuables to him instead of the therapist. You will lose a bit of money this way since the selling price for the therapist is higher but it will be worth it in the end since Ragman is one of the more useful traders. You can also sell Fort armor and Altyns to him which he buys at a considerably higher rate.


For the Peacekeeper, you don’t have to sell anything to him, simply buy Dollars off him and you’re done. 

To gain reputation with the Mechanic, simply ask him to repair items to slowly start to level him while you worm your way into the traders’ good side. When you’ve completely leveled up Prapor, just switch over to the Mechanic sell whatever items the others have rejected.
